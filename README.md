# Carcasonne-group-project
Group project for programming fundamentals tutorials 17L Computer Science Group B

This is our repository for Carcasonne game. I hope that everyone will read some tutorials how to use it. I'll try to learn the most of github's options so I could help you but don't expect too much from me. I hope this will help us to organise our code and communicate. Add any code you have written it might be helpful later on. Please check github as often as you can so you won't fall behind the group. Also please comment your code as much as you can so that we wouldn't spend a huge amount of time on explanation of every single line of code. Please do not edit this document without my permission. You can always make a new one. But please don't make too much of them. And let's work together to make the best game!!!!
